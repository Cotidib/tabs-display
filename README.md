# tabs-display
Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks

This is my version of the Tabs project in ['Code 15 React Projects' course by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo).

### Overview and Learnings

The main React functionality I learned are short-circuit evaluation and dynamic and conditional rendering. I made my own setup, styling and added an extra feature to the original idea of the project.
